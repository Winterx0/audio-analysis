" The human eye has evolved to detect light in the range 380â€”780nm,
a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum known as visible light, which we perceive as colour.
The particular range of wavelengths coincides with a window in the Earth's atmosphere,
through which this light can travel

A frequent way of referring to colour on computer screens is by using the RGB system.
In this model, each colour is given a value for each red, green and blues
components ranging from 0 to 255, giving a total value of 16.7 million possible colours.
However, due to the very complex way in which the eye perceives colours,
we can see colours which are outside of the gamut of the RGB scheme
- there is no unique mapping that definitively converts a wavelength to a colour. "
